;; Exercise 189
;; ------------
;; Here is the function search:
;; 
;;    ; Number List-of-numbers -> Boolean
;;    (define (search n alon)
;;      (cond
;;        [(empty? alon) #false]
;;        [else (or (= (first alon) n)
;;                  (search n (rest alon)))]))
;; 
;; It determines whether some number occurs in a list of numbers. The function
;; may have to traverse the entire list to find out that the number of interest
;; isnâ€™t contained in the list.
;; 
;; Develop the function search-sorted, which determines whether a number occurs
;; in a sorted list of numbers. The function must take advantage of the fact
;; that the list is sorted.
