;; Exercise 388
;; ------------
;; In the real world, wages*.v2 consumes lists of employee structures and lists
;; of work records. An employee structure contains an employeeâ€™s name, social
;; security number, and pay rate. A work record also contains an employeeâ€™s name
;; and the number of hours worked in a week. The result is a list of structures
;; that contain the name of the employee and the weekly wage.
;;
;; Modify the program in this section so that it works on these realistic
;; versions of data. Provide the necessary structure type definitions and data
;; definitions. Use the design recipe to guide the modification process.
