;; Exercise 245
;; ------------
;; Develop the function=at-1.2-3-and-5.775? function. Given two functions from
;; numbers to numbers, the function determines whether the two produce the same
;; results for 1.2, 3, and -5.775.
;;
;; Mathematicians say that two functions are equal if they compute the same
;; result when given the same inputâ€”for all possible inputs.
;;
;; Can we hope to define function=?, which determines whether two functions from
;; numbers to numbers are equal? If so, define the function. If not, explain why
;; and consider the implication that you have encountered the first easily
;; definable idea for which you cannot define a function.

; we can use theorem provers to prove "function=?" for certain functions
; but for any function, function=? is not definable

; My guess is that the collatz conjecture would be trivially proven if
; such a function existed from numbers to numbers
