;; Exercise 83.
;; ------------
;; 
;; Design the function render, which consumes an Editor and produces an image.
;; 
;; The purpose of the function is to render the text within an empty scene of
;; 200 x 20 image pixels. For the cursor, use a 1 x 20 image red rectangle and
;; for the strings, black text of size 16.
;;
;; Develop the image for a sample string in DrRacketâ€™s interactions area. We
;; started with this expression:
;;
;;    (overlay/align "left" "center"
;;                   (text "hello world" 11 "black")
;;                   (empty-scene 200 20))
;;
;; You may wish to read up on beside, above, and such functions. When you are
;; happy with the looks of the image, use the expression as a test and as a
;; guide to the design of render.
