;;    Figure 144: A Janus-faced series of inexact numbers
;;
;; When you add two inexact numbers of vastly different orders of magnitude, you
;; may get the larger one back as the result. For example, if a number system
;; uses only 15 significant digits, we run into problems when adding numbers
;; that vary by more than a factor of image:
;;
;; 1.0 * 10 ^16 + 1 = 1.0000000000000001 * 10 ^ 16
;;
;; but the closest representable answer is 10 ^16
;;
;; At first glance, this approximation doesnâ€™t look too bad. Being wrong by one
;; part in 10 ^ 16 (ten million billion) is close enough to the truth.
;; Unfortunately, this kind of problem can add up to huge problems. Consider the
;; list of numbers in figure 144 and determine the values of these expressions:
;;
;; - (sum JANUS)
;; 
;; - (sum (reverse JANUS))
;; 
;; - (sum (sort JANUS <))
;;
;; Assuming sum adds the numbers in a list from left to right, explain what
;; these expressions compute. What do you think of the results?
;;
;; Generic advice on inexact calculations tells programmers to start additions
;; with the smallest numbers. While adding a big number to two small numbers
;; might yield the big one, adding small numbers first creates a large one,
;; which might change the outcome:
;;
;;    > (expt 2 #i53.0)
;;    #i9007199254740992.0
;;    
;;    > (sum (list #i1.0 (expt 2 #i53.0)))
;;    #i9007199254740992.0
;;    
;;    > (sum (list #i1.0 #i1.0 (expt 2 #i53.0)))
;;    #i9007199254740994.0
;;
;; This trick may *not* work; see the JANUS interactions above.
;;
;; In a language such as ISL+, you can convert the numbers to exact rationals,
;; use exact arithmetic on those, and convert the result back:
;;
;;    (exact->inexact (sum (map inexact->exact JANUS)))
;;
;; Evaluate this expression and compare the result to the three sums above. What
;; do you think now about advice from the web?
