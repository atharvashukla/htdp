;; Exercise 430
;; ------------
;; Develop a variant of quick-sort< that uses only one comparison function,
;; say, <. Its partitioning step divides the given list alon into a list that
;; contains the items of alon smaller than the pivot and another one with those
;; that are not smaller.
;; 
;; Use local to package up the program as a single function. Abstract this
;; function so that it consumes a list and a comparison function.
