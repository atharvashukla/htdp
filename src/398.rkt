;; Exercise 398
;; ------------
;; A linear combination is the sum of many linear terms, that is, products of
;; variables and numbers. The latter are called coefficients in this context.
;; Here are some examples:
;;
;;        5 * x          5 * x + 17 * y        5 * x + 17 * y + 3 * z
;;
;; In all examples, the coefficient of x is 5, that of y is 17, and the one for
;; z is 3.
;;
;; If we are given values for variables, we can determine the value of a
;; polynomial. For example, if x = 10, the value of 5 * x is 50; if x = 10 and
;; y = 1, the value of 5 * x + 17 * y is 67; and if x = 10, y = 1, and z = 2,
;; the value of 5 * x + 17 * y + 3 * z is 73.
;;
;; There are many different representations of linear combinations. We could,
;; for example, represent them with functions. An alternative representation
;; is a list of its coefficients. The above combinations would be represented
;; as:
;;
;;    (list 5)
;;    (list 5 17)
;;    (list 5 17 3)
;;
;; This choice of representation assumes a fixed order of variables.
;;
;; Design value. The function consumes two equally long lists: a linear
;; combination and a list of variable values. It produces the value of the
;; combination for these values.
