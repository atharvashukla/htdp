;; Exercise 397
;; ------------
;; In a factory, employees punch time cards as they arrive in the morning and
;; leave in the evening. Electronic time cards contain an employee number and
;; record the number of hours worked per week. Employee records always contain
;; the name of the employee, an employee number, and a pay rate.
;;
;; Design wages*.v3. The function consumes a list of employee records and a
;; list of time-card records. It produces a list of wage records, which contain
;; the name and weekly wage of an employee. The function signals an error if it
;; cannot find an employee record for a time card or vice versa.
;;
;; *Assumption* There is at most one time card per employee number.
