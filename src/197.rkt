;; Exercise 197
;; ------------
;; Design most-frequent. The function consumes a Dictionary. It produces the
;; Letter-Count for the letter that occurs most often as the first one in the
;; given Dictionary.
;;
;; What is the most frequently used letter in your computerâ€™s dictionary and
;; how often is it used?
;;
;; *Note on Design Choices* This exercise calls for the composition of the
;; solution to the preceding exercise with a function that picks the correct
;; pairing from a list of Letter-Counts. There are two ways to design this
;; latter function:
;; 
;; - Design a function that picks the pair with the maximum count.
;; - Design a function that selects the first from a sorted list of pairs.
;;
;; Consider designing both. Which one do you prefer? Why?
