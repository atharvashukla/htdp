; Exercise 33.
; ------------
;
; Research the “year 2000” problem. 
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; The Year 2000 problem, also known as Y2K, is a class of computer bugs
; related to the formatting and storage of calendar data for dates beginning
; in the year 2000. Problems were anticipated, and arose, because many programs
; represented four-digit years with only the final two digits — making the year
; 2000 indistinguishable from 1900.
