;; Exercise 458
;; ------------
;; Kepler suggested a simple integration method. To compute an estimate of the
;; area under f between a and b, proceed as follows:
;;
;; 1. divide the interval into half at mid = (a + b) / 2;
;;
;; 2. compute the areas of these two trapezoids:
;;    - [(a,0),(a,f(a)),(mid,0),(mid,f(mid))]
;;    - [(mid,0),(mid,f(mid)),(b,0),(b,f(b))];
;;
;; 3. then add the two areas
;;
;; *Domain Knowledge* Letâ€™s take a look at these trapezoids. Here are the two
;; possible shapes, with minimal annotations to reduce clutter:
;;
;; <ex-458-1.png> <ex-458-2.png>
;;
;; The left shape assumes f(L) > f(R) while the right one shows the case where
;; f(L) < f (R). Despite the asymmetry, it is still possible to calculate the
;; area of these trapezoids with a single formula:
;;
;; [(R-L)*f(R)]+[(1/2)*(R-L)*(f(L)-f(R))]
;;
;; Stop! Convince yourself that this formula adds the area of the triangle to
;; the area of the lower rectangle for the left trapezoid, while it subtracts
;; the triangle from the area of the large rectangle for the right one.
;; 
;; Also show that the above formula is equal to
;;
;; (1/2)*(R-L)*(f(L)+f(R))
;;
;; This is a mathematical validation of the asymmetry of the formula.
;;
;; Design the function integrate-kepler. That is, turn the mathematical
;; knowledge into an ISL+ function. Adapt the test cases from figure 165 to this
;; use. Which of the three tests fails and by how much?
