;; Develop the contains? function, which determines whether some given string
;; occurs on a given list of strings.
;;
;; Note BSL actually comes with member?, a function that consumes two values
;; and checks whether the first occurs in the second, a list:
;; 
;;    > (member? "Flatt" (cons "b" (cons "Flatt" '())))
;;    #true
;;
;; Donâ€™t use member? to define the contains? function.
