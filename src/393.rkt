;; Exercise 393
;; ------------
;; Figure 62 presents two data definitions for finite sets. Design the union
;; function for the representation of finite sets of your choice. It consumes
;; two sets and produces one that contains the elements of both.
;; 
;; Design intersect for the same set representation. It consumes two sets and
;; produces the set of exactly those elements that occur in both.
